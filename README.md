# Cross - skilling 

This repository is part of my personal learning journey as I focus on cross-skilling in automation tools. It was inspired by the QE-led Cross-Skilling initiative and serves as a structured space for me to explore, practice, and deepen my understanding of Playwright.

Here, I’ll be working through various test scenarios and practice exercises as I move through different focus areas and gradually building confidence and expertise in using Playwright. This repository will grow and evolve over time, reflecting both my progress and the skills I’m developing along the way.
