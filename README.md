# Cross - skilling 

This repository is created for the Cross-Skilling initiative led by QE. It serves as a learning ground for individuals who want to cross-skill themselves in automation tools.

The purpose of this repository is to host various examples and practice exercises as we move through different focus areas, progressively building expertise in each tool. Over time, this repo will evolve and expand, reflecting our learning journey and mastery of automation technologies.
